MagOpt
allows simulation and simulated annealing optimization of magnetic structures
based on spherical polarimetry (multi datasets) and integrated intensity data.
Additionally a nuclear dataset can be used to normalise magnetic moment (f2nuc_data),
or to insert nuclear intensities into magnetic positions, if the structural part 
causing these intensities is not known (f2magnuc_data).
The nuclear part would be calculated from the nuclear structure as well 
(nuclear-magnetic interference term is working).
