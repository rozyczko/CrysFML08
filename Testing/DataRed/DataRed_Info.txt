Info about DataRed
==================
The same instructions as in the old DataRed are still valid. The current DataRed is not totally finished.
It lacks still testing twins with superspace.


Introduction of space group information:
========================================
SPGR  P b n m  (as in the old version)
SPGR  123    !Giving the number of the space group
SHUB  Pn'ma   !Reading the database of Shubnikov groups in standard setting
SHUB  Pn'ma :: b,c,a;0,0,0  ! This is Pbn'a reading the database of Shubnikov groups in standard setting
SSPG  Pnma(0,0,g)0s0    !Reading the superspace database in standard setting

The most general case is providing generators, this is valid for all kind of space groups
Examples
   3D Group
a) Single line: 
generators  x,y,-z,-1; x,y,z+1/2,-1; -x,-y,-z,1
b) Several lines
gen x,y,-z,-1
gen x,y,z+1/2,-1
gen -x,-y,-z,1

    5D group

generators  x,y,-z,t,-u,1; x,y,z,t+1/2,u,-1; -x,-y,-z,-t,-u,1
or
generators  x1,x2,-x3,x4,-x5,1; x1,x2,x3,x4+1/2,x5,-1; -x1,-x2,-x3,-x4,-x5,1
or in splitted lines as above

This is simplified in DataRed with the following list of generators:

gen x,-y,z,-1 
gen x+1/2,y+1/2,z,1
gen x,y,z+1/2,-1 

The identity is not needed and the second anti-translation is obtained from the first one and the centring translation

New formats and keywords
========================
The new format "HKL_T 11" has been introduced (Jana-like format for input reflections)
The keywords for k-vectors in superspace may be
NQVEC, NQVECT, NKVECT, NKVEC  followed by the number of k-vectors and the number of Q-coefficients (harmonics)
QVEC,KVEC, QVECT,KVECT  followed by three real numbers (components of the k-vector in the parent reciprocal lattice),
a total of NQVEC lines of the above type are needed
Q_COEFF nk1  nk2 ...    Combination of harmonics mixing the modulation vectors

TO_OG  kx,ky,kz     This is to ask fo an output intensity file in FullProf conventional format for magnetic
                    Shubnikov groups of type 4. The provided unit cell should be the conventional cell of the
                    paramagnetic group but the operators of the group should be given in the BNS setting of
                    the magnetic cell. The components [kx,ky,kz] constitute the OG-propagation vector

The keyword MAGNETIC allows to consider that the provided general space group is also that of the magnetic structure
and the reflections are tested for their character (nuclear, magnetic or mixed).
