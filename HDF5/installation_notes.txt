HDF5 installation with Intel compiler

- Windows
  
  Download the pre-built binary distribution from https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5.
  By default, it is installed in C:\Program Files\HDF_Group\HDF5\x.x.x, where x.x.x represents the version number
    
  For compiling, see for example the windows scripts in int3d08/fortran/powder. 

- Linux

  Download the hdf5 source distribution from https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5 for Linux. Distributions for Linux
  are named centos. Before compiling the hdf5 library, you need to install the library zlib. In Ubuntu, this is done 
  easily as follows:
    
  sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
  
  Note that before g is number one, not letter l. After the installation, check the folder where the library has been installed.
  
  'dpkg -L zlib1g-dev'. 
  
  In my case, the library libz.a was stored in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/.

  Install a recent version of cmake: https://cmake.org/download/
  Build the makefiles using the cmake-gui tool. When configuring the build, enable ZLIB support as well as the Fortran build, which 
  is disabled by default. Run make, and then make install as superuser. HDF5 library will be installed in /usr/local/HDF_Group/HDF5.
